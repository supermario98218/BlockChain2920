To Run Program:

   1. Use Java commands on Linux or Eclipse IDE
   
Note: Example outputs are in 10 second increments.
      This can be changed by user through code to 
      any desired period.

Assumptions: For proof of concept, Arduino and 
	     Raspberry Pi values are already 
	     provided. In reality, would obtain
	     through DHT22 Sensor and web-scraping.
